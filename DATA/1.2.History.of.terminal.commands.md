### 1.1 History of terminal commands

Just copy and paste this command to terminal

```
history
```

You can also open history with time.

```
HISTTIMEFORMAT="%d/%m/%y %T " ; history
```

Condition:
If the displayed hours are identical, (incorrect work)  
the system requires that the HISTTIMEFORMAT environment variable must be set much earlier before the event.     
This condition must be met for proper operation.    
The variable can be set for one system boot ( export command )  
or can be set permanently in ~/.bashrc file.

Root account:
If you used the commands with administrator privileges and you are looking for them,  
So you need to run this command with privileges as well.    
Because user history and administrator history are rather kept separate.
