### 1.1 History of terminal commands

Just copy and paste this command to terminal
```
history
```

You can also open history with time
```
HISTTIMEFORMAT="%d/%m/%y %T " ; history
```

If you used the commands with administrator privileges and you are looking for them,  
So you need to run this command with privileges as well.
Because user history and administrator history are rather kept separate.
