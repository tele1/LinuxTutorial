###   11.3 How this tutorial was built

1. I chose the simplest style of writing - **markdown**  
You can find in internet for example  
<https://github.com/tele1/tele1.github.io/blob/main/WebPages/GitHub/test.Markdown.md>  
<https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#syntax>  
<https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet>  
<https://www.xaprb.com/blog/how-to-style-images-with-markdown/>  
<https://markdown-editor.github.io/>  
<https://www.tecmint.com/github-flavored-markdown/>  
<https://sourceforge.net/nf/markdown_syntax>  

2. I chose the best markdown editor for myself - **retext**  
I settings this editor, I don't use "WebKit engine".

3. I split the knowledge into files because it's easier to find the right knowledge and it's easier to edit.

4. Chapter numbering makes it even easier to divide and find knowledge.  
Also each file contains a title and number so you know what it is about.

5. The files do not contain spaces. This is less errors when converting files. 

6. Markdown markup language has its drawbacks.  
This makes it difficult to create a better book. If you know something better, you can recommend to me.
