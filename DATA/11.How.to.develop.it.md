### 11.1 Help develop it.

By the time you are reading this guide, it may no longer be up to date.  
" The world is changing and from time to time someone has to test and write guides again. "

This tutorial aims to write our own thoughts to help users and to improve other tutorial.


### 11.2 Beginning of file.

Each change must be documented with the version change and current date at the beginning of the main file. ( Menu.md ).  
For example, you can copy and paste into the terminal.   
 

```
date +%d/%m/%Y
```

*Example output:*

> $ date +%d/%m/%Y  
10/03/2021


Then add the result at the beginning of the tutorial   


### 11.3 How this tutorial was built.

       


### 11.4 Used markup language:      **Markdown** 

You can find guide in internet for example:

<https://github.com/tele1/tele1.github.io/blob/main/WebPages/GitHub/test.Markdown.md>

<https://markdown-editor.github.io/>  
<https://www.tecmint.com/github-flavored-markdown/>  
<https://sourceforge.net/nf/markdown_syntax>  

### 11.5 Used editor:               **ReText**  

I don't use "WebKit renderer".      
To uncheck:     
ReText --> Edit --> "Use WebKit renderer"


### 11.6 A few words
1. Chapter numbering makes it even easier to divide and find knowledge.  
Also each file contains a title and number so you know what it is about.

2. The files do not contain spaces. This is less errors when converting files. 

3. Markdown markup language has its drawbacks.  
This makes it difficult to me create a better book. 
But I don't have a better idea.
