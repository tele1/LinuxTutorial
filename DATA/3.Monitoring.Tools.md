#### 3.2  Netdata

#### 3.3.1 How it looks

#### 3.3.2 How open

From terminal you can see new service
```
$ sudo netstat -tulpn
Active Internet connections (only servers)
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State       PID/Program name    
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:8125          0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      15947/netdata       
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:19999         0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      15947/netdata       
udp        0      0 127.0.0.1:8125          0.0.0.0:*                           15947/netdata  
```

Then you will know that you can open in web browser website **127.0.0.1:19999**  

#### 3.3.3 Warning 

Netdata groups processes together into one.

 I suspect that if any application from my desktop will eat more RAM, then You will see that lightdm and Xorg also will eat more RAM. But that doesn't have to be true. Just one of the applications.

Read <https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/agent/collectors/apps.plugin>

Check file **/etc/netdata/apps_groups.conf**

Customize to your own needs,  
for example I removed this
```
X: evolution-* firefox chromium opera vivaldi-bin epiphany WebKit*
X: '*systemd --user*' chrome *chrome-sandbox* *google-chrome* *chromium* *firefox*
```

And I added 
```
firefox: *firefox* Web* Privileged* RDD*
mate-terminal: mate-terminal
steam: *steam*
```

And you need restart netdata 
```
service netdata restart
```

#### 3.3  Conky

The theory that you should know:

* Install **conky-all**
*  This set default configuration settings in file ~/.conkyrc
``` 
conky -C > ~/.conkyrc
```

* How run from terminal
```
conky &
```

* How close conky 
```
killall conky 
```
* In ~/.conkyrc you can find word TEXT", after this word next command in this file, will create applicationon the desktop
* " ~ " This mean home directory /home/user_name/
* Name_file with dot "." this mean file is hidden , for example: ~/.conkyrc
* In config file " # " this mean this is only comment 
* If you want improve, check <https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky/wiki>

#### 3.4  GNU Krell Monitors
