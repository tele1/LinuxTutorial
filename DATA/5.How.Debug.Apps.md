## 2. How Debug Apps


### 2.1 Run from Terminal

You can run app from terminal to check errors.


### 2.2 Run from new user account

Many Linux users complain that applications stop working after updating the application.  
This may be due to old application settings.

1. Create new user accout.

2. Log in to the new user account

3. Launch aplication

Conclusions:  

* If the application still does not work, the problem is not with the user settings.  
You have to look for the cause further.

* If the application works, the problem is related to the user's settings in /home/name_user/  
**Solution:**   
Find a way to reset or remove the settings for this application on the old user account.  
The application itself should automatically create new settings.

After testing the application, you can delete the new user account which you do not need. 


### 2.3 Run with default language

Launch the applications in the terminal like this 
```
LC_ALL='C' app name
```
Your language is ignored and the application will start in the default language.  


**Warnings:**  

* Sometimes the applications do not support this properly and may not work.

* If you share application error messages, please use this method instead of a language translator.  
 This will avoid misunderstandings and help you find identical application error messages faster.

* Using this sometimes allows you to avoids **sort** changes after changing the language.

* Using this sometimes allows you to optimize scripts.

### 2.4  How to use strace command

The **strace** command in Linux lets you trace system calls and signals. 

**Warning:**  

* The new version of strace have slightly changed options.

Examples how use:
This command will show you which libraries it is using.

```
$ strace -e openat gnome-calculator
openat(AT_FDCWD, "/etc/ld.so.cache", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
openat(AT_FDCWD, "/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libglib-2.0.so.0", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
openat(AT_FDCWD, "/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgobject-2.0.so.0", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
openat(AT_FDCWD, "/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgtk-3.so.0", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
```

```
$ strace gnome-calculator 2>&1 | grep open
openat(AT_FDCWD, "/etc/ld.so.cache", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
openat(AT_FDCWD, "/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libglib-2.0.so.0", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
openat(AT_FDCWD, "/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgobject-2.0.so.0", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
openat(AT_FDCWD, "/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgtk-3.so.0", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
```

Then you can search which package has this library / which package provide this library.  

* Inside system:
```
$ dpkg -S "/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgtk-3.so.0"
libgtk-3-0:amd64: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgtk-3.so.0
```

* From the database 
```
$ apt-file search "/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgtk-3.so.0"
libgtk-3-0: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgtk-3.so.0
libgtk-3-0: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgtk-3.so.0.2404.14
libgtk-3-0: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgtk-3.so.0.2404.16
```

Note how the application works in another example.  
The application searches for libraries in various places and only when it finds it looks for the next library.
