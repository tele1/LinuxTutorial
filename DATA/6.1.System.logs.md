### 6.1.1 Init

* **Init**            <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Init>

* **Syslog**      <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syslog>
* **Rsyslog**    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsyslog>    
    * Documentation <https://www.rsyslog.com/doc/master/index.html>

In traditional SysVinit system, you have syslog that stores logs in plain text files.

Linux has long been using **Init** and related tools to build a user friendly system.

System logs have been appropriately divided

**/var/log/syslog** or **/var/log/messages** - General message and system related stuff     
**/var/log/boot.log** - System boot log     
**/var/log/kern** - Kernel logs     
**/var/log/dmesg** - Diagnostic message     
and more â€¦      

You see every log has destiny.  <https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LinuxLogFiles>

### 6.1.2 Systemd

**Systemd**  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd>

From some time to now Debian, Ubuntu and also Linux Mint which is based on these distributions use systemd instead init.   

Logging tools have also changed. You should use **journalctl**

The older login system (init) probably exists for compatibility reasons only.

**Info:**   
File is in /var/log/journal/  but this is binary file and you can open with **journalctl** command  
More in:

```
man journalctl
```

```
journalctl --help
```
Later in this tutorial I will mainly discuss how to read a log using a terminal.

However exists also graphics applications for the novice user.   
For example:    
**QJournalctl** - not available in the repository Linux Mint.   
**Mintreport** - available in the repository    

Whatever collects errors, reading system logs and documentation is a standard.
