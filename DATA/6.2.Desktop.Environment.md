### 6.2 Desktop Environment

#### 6.2.1 File Log

The errors are logged to **~/.xsession-errors**  

You can display them ignoring other information,
displaying only lines with known keywords suggesting errors, e.g.

```sh
grep 'fail\|error\|could not' ~/.xsession-errors
```


#### 6.2.2 Old configuration files

One of the most common environment errors is wrong configuration files.     

* Create a new user account and log in there.
* If the problem does not exist in the new user account, then in the old user account the problem is in the old configuration files.
* If the problem still exists in the new user account, then the problem is different.

Depending on your desktop environment, find its home page and read the appropriate guide on how to delete old settings.

**For example:**    
From a no longer active website ( I used web.archive.org )  
<https://forum.kde.org/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=38828>

I know that in KDE depending on its version, this had different paths:
```
~/.kde/share/config  
~/.kde4/share/config
```

**Warning** !     
- After removing the settings, you may be greeted with a black screen to which you will have to copy the default settings from /etc/skel/  or wallpaper, menu bar and other things manually.      
( Usually by right-clicking the mouse. )  
- A file with a dot at the beginning is hidden.  
To see hidden files, you must unhide them in the file manager settings.
