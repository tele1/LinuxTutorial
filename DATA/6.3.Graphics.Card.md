For **Nvidia**      
├──> **Nouveau**  3D open source driver from **Mesa** package    
├──> **Vesa**  old and only 2D open source driver from **Mesa** package    
└──> **Nvidia**  3D proprietary drivers <https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia>

For **AMD**     
├──> **Ati / Radeon**  3D open source driver from **Mesa** package <https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RadeonDriver>    
├──> **Catalyst**  3D proprietary driver

└──> **AMDGPU PRO**  3D proprietary driver <https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AMDGPU-PRO-Driver>

For **Intel**   
└──> **Intel** 3D open source driver from **Mesa** package

-------------------------------

Info about **Vesa** driver

*    is a very old driver, so not all graphics cards have to support it.
*    display resolutions is limited 
*    has low requirements and is therefore still supported for some devices

So if you don't need to rescue your system in graphical mode or to use other job then don't use this driver.

#### 6.3.3 Check which driver you have

##### 6.3.3.1 With "glxinfo"

Copy and paste in terminal **glxinfo | grep OpenGL**

```
$ glxinfo | grep OpenGL
OpenGL vendor string: NVIDIA Corporation
OpenGL renderer string: GeForce GTX 660/PCIe/SSE2
OpenGL core profile version string: 4.6.0 NVIDIA 450.80.02
OpenGL core profile shading language version string: 4.60 NVIDIA
...
```

##### 6.3.3.2 With "inxi"

Copy and paste in terminal **inxi -Fxxxz**

```
$ inxi -Fxxxz
...

#### 6.3.4 Additional information

##### 6.3.4.1 Linux Hybrid Graphics

Some laptops have and can run two graphics cards on the motherboard.    
The first is integrated and is usually part of the processor.   
 The second is called a dedicated graphics card.

For Nvidia inside nvidia settings you can find the switch <https://i.stack.imgur.com/NixuN.png>

About Bumblebee 1 <https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bumblebee>   
About Bumblebee 2 <https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Bumblebee>

##### 6.3.4.2 Bios

If you have more than one graphics card.    
On the computer in Bios you can switch the graphics card

Commonly used abbreviations :   
**PEG** --> PCI Express Graphics    
**IGD** --> Integrated Graphic Device  --> ( graphics card built into the processor )   
**PCI** --> PCI Graphic Device  
**AGP** -->  Accelerated Graphics Port

**In case of any doubts or problems, refer to the operating manual of the motherboard manufacturer.**

If you have replaced the cable with a different type and connected the cable to a different socket on the monitor,  
  it may be necessary to manually select the signal input used (VGA, HDMI, DVI, DisplayPort, ...)   
from the monitor menu or to switch it with the button on the monitor. (e.g. "INPUT" button)

**In case of any doubts or problems, refer to the operating instructions of the monitor manufacturer.**

#### 6.3.5 Tips

##### 6.3.5.1 Black screen after system installation


**Symptom**     
After system installation only logo is displayed and then a black screen.

Probably the linux distro doesn't support your graphics card yet    
or not anymore.    
Please try to set the option "nomodeset"    
<https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/pl-pl/000123893/manual-nomodeset-kernel-boot-line-option-for-linux-booting?lang=en>

The tutorial shows two solutions for setting the nomodeset option

*   The first is a temporary <- setting recommended to test if it works
*   The second option is a permanent setting. <- recommended when we already know that we will not start the system without this option.

 
##### 6.3.5.2 You do not see errors at startup

*   Start the computer and after the list appears, press **e** key to go to the edition of the "startup procedure"
*   We are looking for a fragment of **quiet splash**
*   Remove the word **quiet splash**
*   Start the system again


##### 6.3.5.3 Recovery mode in GRUB menu

The option in the Grub menu that allows to boot the system in text mode.    
(on some systems it is hidden)  
This option comes in handy when we need to see the logs in text mode and repair our system.
