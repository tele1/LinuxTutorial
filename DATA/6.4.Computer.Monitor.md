#### 6.4.1 EDID

Extended display identification data (EDID)

EDID is a data structure provided by a digital display to describe its capabilities to a video source. The EDID includes manufacturer name and serial number, product type, phosphor or filter type, timings supported by the display, display size, luminance data and (for digital displays only) pixel mapping data. 

If the computer cannot read EDID from monitor then system may set the wrong resolution.

Example:

```
# monitor-edid

 Name: L1918S
 EISA ID: GSM4b31
 EDID version: 1.3
 EDID extension blocks: 0
 Screen size: 37.6 cm x 30.1 cm (18.96 inches, aspect ratio 5/4 = 1.25)
 Gamma: 2.2
 Analog signal
 Max video bandwidth: 140 MHz

    HorizSync 30-83
    VertRefresh 56-75

    # Monitor preferred modeline (60.0 Hz vsync, 64.0 kHz hsync, ratio 5/4, 86 dpi)
    ModeLine "1280x1024" 108 1280 1328 1440
1688 1024 1025 1028 1066 +hsync +vsync
```

On Ubuntu / Linux Mint install **read-edid** package and run command to get EDID

```
sudo get-edid | parse-edid
```

#### 6.4.2 HiDPi Scaling

On some laptops with small screens and FullHD and above screen resolutions, the font may be blurry. Because old images and fonts were made of pixels with certain sizes. Sometimes called raster graphics    
The fonts just don't match to new resolution and are render badly.  
The problem probably not exist with pictures of vector graphics.

If the software supports HiDPi then your system can rescale the image and fix the problem.
