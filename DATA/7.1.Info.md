### 7.1 Info


I will give most of the examples from the terminal.     

You should know:

**~**    --> tilde --> user home folder  /home/user_name/      
**.**    --> dot --> the file with a leading dot in its name is hidden by default     
**$**   --> dollar --> means that you are logged in terminal in normal user account     
**#**   --> hash  --> means that you are logged in terminal in root / administrator account


If you are a beginner and do not know the terminal,     
I recommend that you get to know it and learn how to use it.    
There are many tutorials about the terminal that you can watch as well.

A lot of the time I use the "**grep**" command to display errors.   

*    Remember that "**grep**" will only display lines with the searched word.    
Therefore, sometimes it makes sense to look for the displayed fragment in the log to read the whole error.

*    If you see signs "^", ".", "*" and "$" with **"grep"** command, these are "regular expression metacharacters"  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression#POSIX_basic_and_extended>

**Tips for beginner**  

*   Copy and paste command in order not to make a mistake.    

*   Some beginners complain that someone tells you to copy and paste something, but they don't know what any command do. On the internet you will find it.

man name_command

Instead of "man" command, you can use a graphics program "yelp".   
There is a word finder. Sometimes it comes in handy.

```
yelp man:command
