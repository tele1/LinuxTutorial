## 8. Compressing logs


File compression allows you to transfer files faster and easier. Especially if there is a size limitation.      
Just, add the file to the forum as an attachment.

----

### 8.1 Text file

For example with "syslog" file to "name_file.gz"
```
gzip -c /var/log/syslog > Log.1.syslog.gz
```

Or to "name_file.zip"

```
zip Log.1.syslog.zip /var/log/syslog
```

*   Command "pwd" in terminal will show you where you are in terminal and where to look for the file. Usually this is the user's home directory.

*   You can unpack the zipped file with a graphics program designed for this purpose    
For example with "Engrampa". It's simple, so I will skip how to do it.

### 8.2 Output of journalctl


#### 8.2.1 Compression method to zip file.

```
journalctl -b0 > File1.log ; zip File1.zip File1.log
```

Output of command **journalctl** is redirect to **File1.log**   
Next **File1.log** will be compressed into a file named **File1.zip**

----

#### 8.2.2 Compression method to .xz file.

```
journalctl -b0 | xz -c > File2.log.xz
```

The output of command **journalctl** immediately is redirected to the **xz** command and written to a compressed file **File2.log.xz** .
